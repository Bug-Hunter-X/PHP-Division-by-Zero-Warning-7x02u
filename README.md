# PHP Division by Zero Warning

This example demonstrates how PHP handles division by zero and how to mitigate potential issues.  PHP's approach differs from languages with stricter type systems.  The code includes a solution to avoid warnings and ensure robust error handling.  The script will now gracefully handle the division by zero cases, preventing unexpected behavior and runtime issues.
